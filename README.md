# IVR_Assignment

All code can be found in the file `image1.py` due to data communication issues we faced. The CV portion is first, followed by the kinematics part. To run the relevant part of code for a question, uncomment the code in the `callback2` function that is titled with that section.

## Running the Code:
Each section should be run individually. Comment out other sections which are not tested.

Within the `callback2` function, after both images are retrieved from individual callback functions,
Section 2.1 contains the topic publication of actual values and estimated values for the joint angles.
Section 2.2 contains the publication of the estimated target detection position.
Section 3.2 contains the publication of the estimated end effector position using inverse kinematics.
